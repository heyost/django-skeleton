# Django's development server will automatically serve static files for you,
# but in production, Django expects your web server to take care of that. You
# will need to set STATIC_ROOT to a directory on your filesystem, and
# STATIC_URL to something like "/static/". Then configure your webserver to
# serve that directory at that url.
# Finally, run "manage.py collectstatic" and django will copy static files
# from various places into your STATIC_ROOT. You need to re-run collectstatic
# each time you redeploy with changes to static files.

# your app involves writing to the filesystem using the default storage class
